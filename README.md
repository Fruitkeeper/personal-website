# Personal website

A single full-screen page: a 3D sad toaster robot (Three.js) whose head follows your cursor. Built with Astro; deployed on Vercel.

> The earlier full site (header, projects, blog, about, RSS) is preserved at the git tag `full-site-before-strip`:
> `git checkout full-site-before-strip -- src tests` restores its files.

## The toaster

- Scene: `src/scripts/toaster-scene.ts` (pure math in `src/lib/toaster.ts`), mounted by `src/components/Toaster.astro`.
- Only the head turns toward the cursor; the body bobs and hops when clicked. Paused in hidden tabs; still frame under `prefers-reduced-motion`; glow placeholder if WebGL or the model fails.

## The 3D model

The source `sad_toaster.glb` (Sketchfab export, 4.4MB) is gitignored. `npm run build:model` (`tools/build-model.mjs`) turns it into `public/models/sad-toaster.glb` (~0.5MB):

1. converts the legacy spec/gloss material to metal/rough (three.js no longer reads spec/gloss);
2. splits the mesh into **Body** and **Head** by connected parts above `NECK_Y`, and adds a `HeadPivot` node at the neck rod, which the site rotates so only the head turns;
3. compresses (meshopt geometry, 1024px WebP texture), keeping that node hierarchy.

`node tools/build-model.mjs analyze|islands sad_toaster.glb` prints the height profile and parts used to choose `NECK_Y`.

For a different model: adjust `NECK_Y` (or drop the split; the site just won't turn a head it can't find), update `MODEL_URL`/`MODEL_YAW` in `src/scripts/toaster-scene.ts`, and its credit in `src/config/site.ts`. The model is auto-scaled and framed.
